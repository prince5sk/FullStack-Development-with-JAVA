        <H3>LOVE  and  RELATIONSHIP</H3>
        <pre>
        ….everything that makes a relationship “work” (and by work, I mean that it is happy 
  and sustainable for both people involved) requires a genuine, deep-level admiration for 
  each other. Without that mutual admiration, everything else will unravel.
         It’s useful to point out that love, itself, is neutral. It is something that can be 
  both healthy or unhealthy, helpful or harmful, depending on why and how you love someone 
  else and are loved by someone else. By itself, love is never enough to sustain a relationship.


        Have realistic expectations about relationships and romance
  There will be days, or weeks, or maybe even longer, when you aren’t all mushy-gushy in-love. 
  You’re even going to wake up some morning and think, “Ugh, you’re still here….” That’s normal! 
  And more importantly, sticking it out is totally worth it, because that, too, will change. 
  In a day, or a week, or maybe even longer, you’ll look at that person and a giant wave of love 
  will inundate you, and you’ll love them so much you think your heart can’t possibly hold it all 
  and is going to burst. Because a love that’s alive is also constantly evolving. It expands and 
  contracts and mellows and deepens. It’s not going to be the way it used to be, or the way it will 
  be, and it shouldn’t be.
      True love—that is, deep, abiding love that is impervious to emotional whims or fancy—is a choice. It’s a constant commitment to a person regardless of the present circumstances. It’s a commitment to a person who you understand isn’t going to always make you happy—nor should they!—and a person who will need to rely on you at times, just as you will rely on them.
That form of love is much harder. Primarily because it often doesn’t feel very good. It’s unglamorous. It’s lots of early morning doctor’s visits. It’s cleaning up bodily fluids you’d rather not be cleaning up. It’s dealing with another person’s insecurities and fears and ideas, even when you don’t want to.
But this form of love is also far more satisfying and meaningful. And, at the end of the day, it brings true happiness, not just another series of highs.


The most important factor in a relationship is not communication, but respect
As we scanned through the hundreds of responses we received, my assistant and I began to notice an interesting trend. People who had been through divorces and/or had only been with their partners for 10-15 years almost always talked about communication being the most important part of making things work. Talk frequently. Talk openly. Talk about everything, even if it hurts. And there is some merit to that (which I’ll get to later). But we noticed that the thing people with marriages going on 20, 30, or even 40 years talked about most was respect. My sense is that these people, through sheer quantity of experience, have learned that communication, no matter how open, transparent and disciplined, will always break down at some point. Conflicts are ultimately unavoidable, and feelings will always be hurt. And the only thing that can save you and your partner, that can cushion you both to the hard landing of human fallibility, is an unerring respect for one another, the fact that you hold each other in high esteem, believe in one another—often more than you each believe in yourselves—and trust that your partner is doing his/her best with what they’ve got. Without that bedrock of respect underneath you, you will doubt each other’s intentions. You will judge their choices and encroach on their independence. You will feel the need to hide things from one another for fear of criticism. And this is when the cracks in the edifice begin to appear.
